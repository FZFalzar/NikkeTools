Drag drop folder onto exe containing encrypted for default decryption mode, decrypted assets will have "_dec.bundle" added to the back of name, which can then be opened with your favorite asset bundle viewer  

To encrypt, append _MOD to each modded asset bundle's filename, then drag drop folder containing these modded asset bundle files onto exe. After encryption, a new file with _MOD_ENC in the filename will be created, strip this from the filename and replace file in /eb
